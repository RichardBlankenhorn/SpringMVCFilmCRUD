## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project
## Film Query
#### Team: Alan Frederick, Richard Blankenhorn, Grace Carter

The goal of this project is to create a web application using Spring MVC and a SQL database with create, read, update, and delete functionality. The DAO implementation uses JDBC to persist and retrieve data. 

We created a Film Query Database that allows the user to search the database by film id and keyword, add a film, and delete that film. These options are accessed from an HTML home page. 

#### Deliverables
* User enters a Film ID or a film keyword to search the database and retrieve all available information on that film
* User can add a film to the database
* User can delete the film they added
* User can edit a film that is in the database

#### Technologies Used
* DAO pattern and jsp-views to build the CRUD functionality.   
* connected to a SQL database
* basic HTML and CSS on the index page
* Git and GitHub

#### Lessons learned and future to-dos
Being our first group project, we got some hands-on experience with merge conflicts.
